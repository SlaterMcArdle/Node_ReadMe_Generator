  ## Description
  This project's goal was to create a command line based readme generator using node.js.
  It utilized the inquirer and filesystem packages. 
  It asks the user to input info for all of the relevant sections, then creates a template literal with the markdown.
  It writes the markdown template string into a readme file.
